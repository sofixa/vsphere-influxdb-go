# Description and Features
This is a tool written in Go that helps you do your own custom tailored monitoring, capacity planning and performance debugging of VMware based infrastructures. It collects all possible metrics from vCenters and ESXi hypervisors about hosts, clusters, resource pools, datastores and virtual machines and sends them to an [InfluxDB database](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) (a popular open source time series database project written in Go), which you can then visualise in Grafana (links to sample dashboards [below](#example-dashboards)) or Chronograf, and use Grafana, Kapacitor or custom scripts to do alerting based on your needs, KPIs, capacity plannings/expectations.

# Install 
Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/Oxalide/vsphere-influxdb-go/releases/latest) for your OS (deb, rpm packages, exes, archives for Linux, Darwin, Windows, FreeBSD on amd64, arm6, arm7, arm64 are available) and install it.

For Debian/Ubuntu on adm64:
```
curl -L -O $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/sofixa/vsphere-influxdb-go/releases | grep browser_download_url | grep '64[.]deb' | head -n 1 | cut -d '"' -f 4)
dpkg -i vsphere-influxdb-go*.deb
```

CentOS/Red Hat on amd64:
```
curl -L -O $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/sofixa/vsphere-influxdb-go/releases | grep browser_download_url | grep '64[.]rpm' | head -n 1 | cut -d '"' -f 4)
rpm -i vsphere-influxdb-go*.rpm
```

This will install vsphere-influxdb-go in /usr/local/bin/vsphere-influxdb-go and an example configuration file in /etc/vsphere-influxdb-go.json that needs to be edited.


# Configure

The JSON configuration file in /etc/vsphere-influxdb-go.json contains all your vCenters/ESXi to connect to, the InfluxDB connection details(url, username/password, database to use), and the metrics to collect(full list [here](http://www.virten.net/2015/05/vsphere-6-0-performance-counter-description/) ).
Additionally  you can provide a vCenter/ESXi server and InfluxDB connection details via environment variables, wich is extremly helpful when running inside a container.

For InfluxDB set INFLUX\_HOSTNAME, INFLUX\_USERNAME, INFLUX\_PASSWORD and INFLUX\_DATABASE.
For vSphere set VSPHERE\_HOSTNAME, VSPHERE\_USERNAME and VSPHERE\_PASSWORD and keep in mind, that currently only one vCenter/ESXi can be added via environment variable.

If you set a domain, it will be automaticaly removed from the names of the found objects.

Metrics collected are defined by associating ObjectType groups with Metric groups.

**Note: Not all metrics are available directly, you might need to change your metric collection level.**
A table with the level needed for each metric is availble [here](http://www.virten.net/2015/05/which-performance-counters-are-available-in-each-statistic-level/), and you can find a python script to change the collect level in the [tools folder of the project](./tools/).

# Run as a service

Create a crontab to run it every X minutes(one minute is fine - in our case, ~30 vCenters, ~100 ESXi and ~1400 VMs take approximately 25s to collect all metrics - rather impressive, i might add).
```
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/vsphere-influxdb-go
```

# Example dashboards
* https://grafana.com/dashboards/1299 (thanks to @exbane )
* https://grafana.com/dashboards/3556 (VMware cloud overview, mostly provisioning/global cloud usage stats)
* https://grafana.com/dashboards/3571 (VMware performance, mostly VM oriented performance stats)

Contributions welcome!


# Compile from source

```

go get github.com/oxalide/vsphere-influxdb-go

```
This will install the project in your $GOBIN($GOPATH/bin). If you have appended $GOBIN to your $PATH, you will be able to call it directly. Otherwise, you'll have to call it with its full path.
Example:
```
vsphere-influxdb-go
```
or :
```
$GOBIN/vsphere-influxdb-go
```

# TODO before v1.0
* Add service discovery(or probably something like [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for easier and more flexible configuration with multiple backends)
* Daemonize
* Provide a ready to use Dockerfile

You are welcome to contribute!
